        Our farm supplies all the chicken we serve, ensuring top quality and freshness.Later this year, we will begin vegetable production, starting with fresh basil and romaine lettuce.As our farm expands, so will our ability to provide more homegrown ingredients, cutting out the middlemen and delivering better flavors at a lower cost.

        Our story isn& apos;t just about making pizza—it & apos;s about creating a better way to eat: fresher, more affordable, and straight from our farm to your table.`
